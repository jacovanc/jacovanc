# Hi, I'm Jaco 👋
I'm a Web Developer that's interested in language learning and have found myself creating various projects related to this.

🌍 You can check out the language learning app I created, [Polyglot Pal](https://polyglotpal.co.uk)!

 🇩🇪 Learning German coincidentally? Get [Daily Language Challenges](https://dailylanguagechallenge.com) that I post every day.
